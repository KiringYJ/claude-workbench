**BLOCKED: Compound `cd` command detected.**

Do not use `cd <path> && command`. The working directory persists between Bash calls.

**Correct approach:**
1. Run `cd <path>` once as a standalone call at the start of the session
2. Use bare commands in all subsequent calls (e.g., `cargo test`, `git status`)
