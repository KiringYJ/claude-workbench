# agent-workbench

`agent-workbench` helps teams keep AI coding-agent instructions consistent across Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and other agents.

Use it when you want one project guide that every agent can read, instead of maintaining separate, duplicated instructions for each tool.

> Historical note: this repository may still appear as `claude-workbench` in some checkouts, but the project is now vendor-neutral.

## What it gives your project

A sync creates a small set of agent instruction files in your project:

- `AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md` — shared generated guidance for agents.
- `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md` — your manually maintained project-specific notes.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `GEMINI.md` — thin entrypoints for vendor tools.
- Optional project-scoped agent config and portable workflows under `.agents/`.

It does **not** require marketplace installs, global configuration, git submodules, plugins, or machine-local paths.

## Quick start

Open your target project in an AI coding agent, then ask it to run the sync prompt:

```text
Follow the agent-workbench sync prompt at:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KiringYJ/agent-workbench/main/prompts/sync-agent-workbench.md

Run a full sync with the <profile> profile.
Do not modify application source code.
Do not install dependencies, plugins, marketplaces, global config, or submodules.
```

Choose one of these profiles:

| Profile | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| `base` | You want general agent guidance without language-specific rules. |
| `rust` | The project is primarily Rust. |
| `python` | The project is primarily Python. |
| `typescript` | The project is primarily TypeScript or JavaScript. |

After the first sync, fill in `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md` with your project's architecture, build commands, test commands, important files, domain terms, and project-specific constraints.

## Common tasks

### Update an already-synced project

```text
Follow the agent-workbench sync prompt at:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KiringYJ/agent-workbench/main/prompts/sync-agent-workbench.md

Run a full sync using the existing .agent-workbench.yaml profile.
Preserve AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md and marked manual blocks.
Do not modify application source code.
```

### Audit without changing files

```text
Follow the agent-workbench audit prompt at:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KiringYJ/agent-workbench/main/prompts/audit-agent-workbench.md

Audit this repository for agent-workbench compliance.
Do not modify files.
```

### Repair missing or malformed instruction files

```text
Follow the agent-workbench repair prompt at:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KiringYJ/agent-workbench/main/prompts/repair-agent-workbench.md

Repair missing or malformed agent instruction files.
Preserve project-specific content.
Do not modify application source code.
```

## What sync is allowed to change

Sync is intentionally narrow. It may update agent instruction files, project-scoped agent configuration, and registered portable workflows. It must not change application source code, dependencies, global/user configuration, marketplace/plugin installation state, or git submodules.

`AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md` is created if missing, but after that it belongs to your project and should be edited by hand.

## For maintainers of this repository

Most users do not need the repository internals. If you are changing the workbench itself, start with:

- `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md` for project architecture and verification expectations.
- `manifest.yaml` for registered modules, profiles, and templates.
- `guide/`, `profiles/`, `templates/`, `prompts/`, `skills/`, and `capabilities/` for the source content used by sync.

For documentation-only changes, verify with:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --stat
```
