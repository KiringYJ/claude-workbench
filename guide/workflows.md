# Portable Agent Workflows

Every synchronized project should carry the same core workflows regardless of which coding agent is active. Use the Agent Skills standard directly instead of describing each workflow again through a capability registry or per-vendor adapter files.

## Canonical Project-Local Locations

- `.agents/prompts/` stores supporting prompt workflows that any capable coding agent can read and execute.
- `.agents/skills/` stores the canonical project copies of portable Agent Skills, including optional `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` resources.
- `.agents/guardrails/` stores vendor-neutral guardrail documents.
- `.agent-workbench.lock.json` records sync provenance, scoped baselines, installed artifacts, and retained removals. Keep `.agent-workbench.yaml` as human-owned desired configuration.

`manifest.yaml` registers prompts and skills directly. Do not introduce a second registry that repeats their paths, portability labels, vendor targets, or fallback behavior.

## Vendor Discovery Boundary

Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and other compatible agents should discover the shared `.agents/skills/` tree directly.

Claude Code uses `.claude/skills/` for project skill discovery. When the Claude target is enabled, sync should copy the registered managed source/resource set for each canonical skill from `.agents/skills/<name>/` to `.claude/skills/<name>/` without appending adapter prose or changing its resources. Corresponding managed files must be byte-identical; unregistered local files remain preserved only in `.agents/skills/`. The Claude copy is a generated discovery mirror, not another source of truth. Use real copied files rather than symlinks so synchronized repositories behave consistently on Windows and other environments.

Do not generate `.codex/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/`, or `.opencode/skills/` mirrors by default. Create a vendor-specific file only when it encodes actual runtime behavior that the shared standard cannot express, such as loader configuration, permissions, hooks, invocation controls, or vendor metadata.

## Required Portable Workflows

| Workflow | Canonical artifacts |
| --- | --- |
| Workbench sync and audit | `.agents/prompts/sync-agent-workbench.md`, `.agents/prompts/audit-agent-workbench.md`, `.agents/prompts/repair-agent-workbench.md`, `.agents/skills/sync-agent-workbench/SKILL.md` |
| Loop until done | `.agents/prompts/loop-until-done.md`, `.agents/skills/loop-until-done/SKILL.md` |
| Guardrail authoring | `.agents/prompts/create-guardrail.md`, `.agents/skills/guardrail-authoring/SKILL.md` |
| Skill authoring | `.agents/prompts/create-agent-skill.md`, `.agents/skills/skill-authoring/SKILL.md` |
| Commit workflow | `.agents/prompts/commit-workflow.md`, `.agents/skills/commit-workflow/SKILL.md` |
| Linus-style review | `.agents/prompts/linus-review.md`, `.agents/skills/linus-review/SKILL.md` |
| Integrate a linked ChatGPT conversation | `.agents/skills/integrate-chatgpt-conversation/SKILL.md` |

## Portability Rules

- Treat install as the first sync. The same workflow should detect new, legacy/no-lockfile, and already-managed repositories.
- Use `.agent-workbench.lock.json` as a provenance/baseline ledger, not a package-manager lockfile.
- Classify sync drift as confirmed upstream removal, confirmed removal with local edits, suspected legacy removal, deselected by local config, source changed / migration required, or local unmanaged.
- Never delete downstream artifacts without explicit user confirmation. Record a decision to retain an obsolete managed artifact in `retainedRemovals`.
- Keep skills within the standard `SKILL.md` format unless an explicit target requires an extension.
- Prefer a compatible built-in or installed implementation when the active environment provides one, but keep the portable skill available as the project-owned fallback.
- Store any vendor preference or fallback rule once in the canonical skill or supporting prompt, not in four parallel adapter notes.
- Do not make a consumer project depend on a marketplace, plugin, extension, global configuration, submodule, or machine-local path.
- Keep generated workflows in English and project-local.

If a native feature is missing, unstable, or disabled, execute the canonical `.agents/skills/` or `.agents/prompts/` workflow directly.

## Skill Model and Reasoning Routing

### Workload selection

User-selected operating policy, adopted on 2026-09-07: optimize Codex allowance
per successfully completed, verified unit of work while accounting for both
engineering and research-level mathematics. These are working allocations,
not a measured universal Pareto frontier. Do not turn general intelligence
scores or coding benchmark dollars into research-math capability rankings or
weekly allowance percentages.

[Official OpenAI usage guidance](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/pricing)
distinguishes included ChatGPT-plan allowance from API-key billing and explains
that usage varies with the model and actual task. API benchmark cost is not a
direct conversion to the user's five-hour or weekly usage percentage. Keep
uncertainty explicit; validate allocation choices with attributable task-level
outcomes and host-reported usage when available.

| Work class | Model | Effort | Selection rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| peripheral | `gpt-5.6-luna` | `max` | Repository search, metadata, bulk reading, notation/LaTeX formatting, routine refactoring with established semantics, Lean boilerplate, and running existing proofs/tests. |
| technical | `gpt-5.6-sol` | `medium` | Nontrivial implementation, large-codebase understanding, technical debugging, and translating an established argument into code. |
| mixed | `gpt-5.6-sol` | `high` | Difficult engineering or math/code integration that consumes established mathematical facts and does not decide a new mathematical claim. |
| research-math | `gpt-6-astra` | `medium` | Theorem truth, sufficient hypotheses, well-defined maps, generalizations, obstructions, proof gaps, counterexamples, and theorem-statement faithfulness. |
| critical-proof | `gpt-6-astra` | `max` | Important main theorems, fatal gaps, long cross-lemma arguments, new formal proof search, adversarial proof audits, or unusually high failure-cost obligations. |

Classify the substance of each stage before selecting a skill's ordinary
default. Apply the critical-proof criterion first, then research-math, then
mixed/technical/peripheral. Mathematical substance goes directly to
`gpt-6-astra` / `medium`; qualifying critical proof work goes directly to `gpt-6-astra` / `max`.
Neither requires first failing on Luna or Sol. Use `gpt-6-astra` / `max` also when an
adequate `gpt-6-astra` / `medium` attempt exposes a genuine remaining mathematical impasse.

Sol is an intermediate option for technical work, not a mandatory stop on the
way to mathematical research. A math repository or a .tex/.lean extension alone
does not select Astra: changing notation or executing an existing proof stays
peripheral. Conversely, a "formatting", "review", or "debugging" label must not
downgrade a stage that is actually deciding mathematical correctness. If a Lean
failure could reflect either a library/API issue or false mathematics, separate
the mechanical diagnosis from the mathematical obligation and route the latter
to research-math or critical-proof.

Retain the five listed combinations as the ordinary operating set without
creating fixed-combination agents. Other combinations remain available under
an explicit user override or a separately evidenced policy revision. Do not
change the active main model merely because a new skill is invoked.
Maintain proof/heuristic/open-obligation distinctions; higher effort does not
justify claiming theorem closure. Diagnose missing tools/data/environment
failures before changing the reasoning allocation.

### Dispatch rules

This is the canonical dispatch table for installed skills. It chooses a default
combination for the *skill's first eligible stage*, not a new fixed agent role
or a promise that a runtime will honour an override. An explicit user-selected
model or effort wins. Before invoking a skill, look up its exact full name,
then its explicit aliases in this table. The workload selection above overrides
a skill's ordinary default for mathematical or critical-proof substance. If a
skill is not listed, use its work-class pair and report that it was unmapped. Load that skill's
original `SKILL.md` before work. For independent work, pass the path and a
bounded scope to an eligible child; do not auto-create a new task or launch a
CLI workflow.

When the native generic child surface supports overrides, dispatch its explicit
`model` and `reasoning_effort` fields separately, with `fork_turns` set to
`none` or a bounded recent history as the task needs. Keep model and effort
independent; do not create an agent definition for each pair. For a skill whose named
specialist is fixed at an incompatible pair, use that generic child only when
the runtime permits it; otherwise keep the current parent settings and report
the recommended pair and actual settings separately.

`Bounded child` means a separately reviewable read, implementation, or review
slice. `Leader workflow` remains in the parent, which owns its state,
orchestration, and final decision. `Parent-bound tool` remains in the parent
because it needs the current browser, UI, authenticated connector, live Excel,
or artifact session. Typed roles or a runtime may fix a model and reject an
override; choose an unconfigured eligible child only when the active runtime
supports the requested pair, otherwise keep the stage with the parent and
state that limitation. Image-generation models are selected by their tool, not
by this reasoning table.

Keep every required specialist lane and its evidence contract. For a dynamic
generic child, include the original specialist instructions as well as the skill
and bounded assignment. A missing required independent review is a blocker,
not permission for the author to self-review. A workflow that requires an
unavailable runtime remains unavailable; this table does not substitute a
different execution engine. Source-order rules apply to the skill handler's
own work; unrelated parent work may continue independently.
